<p> NETWORK SECURITY (NTS)
    NTS103 CREDITS: 3 PREREQUISITE(S): NONE
    Identity Protection and Personal Security
    One of the most prolific crimes that is occurring in modern society is identity theft. This is perpetuated by the rise of social media, online
    presence and lack of education on proper protections of your personal information. There is also a physical risk with this type of information.
    This course explores the critical life skills needed to better protect your identity and yourself in today’s society.
     </p>
     <p>Security Essentials
        The goal of this course is to provide network administrators with the knowledge to design and implement an effective security strategy in a
        competitive corporate networking environment. This course will explore security-by design utilizing anti-virus tools, security policies and
        practices, password management, risk analysis and assessments, network vulnerabilities, enhancing security through cabling and network
        hardware, understanding different types of firewalls, packet filtering and NAT, setting up and securing a VPN, and understanding
        contemporary hacker exploits. </p>
        <p>Information Governance
            As the front line of the 21st century information age will you be managing information appropriately while considering the threats you
            face? Information is managed by a wide range of elements that must be considered as part of the full equation. The laws and regulations
            that apply to the business, the importance placed on the information by business leadership, the expectations of the customer, and of course
            the desire for the most reasonable protections to the information in support of all objectives. This course focuses on how all these elements
            come together to create and manage the information governance of the organization. </p>
            <p> Social Engineering
                Have you ever fallen victim to a phishing scam? Why are these scams so successful? Scams are based on specific attributes of individual
                decision-making processes known as cognitive biases or bugs in the human system. Social engineering is developing the art of persuasion to
                gather confidential information from individuals that would normally not disclose this data. A successful social engineer does not need to
                solely rely on hard technical skills to access information systems. This is a project-based course that will provide examination of historical
                exploits and develop the necessary skills to successfully use the art of social engineering to access confidential information in a corporate
                environment and develop defense measures. </p>
                <p> Applied Exploits
                    When discussing practical network security, we must acknowledge that all systems have vulnerabilities. This course combines the
                    fundamental and historical perspective of hacking methodologies and applied hands-on skills. Hacking topics are explored to examine the
                    current systems associated with these vulnerable points. This is an applied hands-on course requiring the use of a variety of modern operating
                    systems. Typical walkthroughs explore the standard hacking methodologies such as discovery, footprinting, targeting, attacks, penetration,
                    escalation of privileges and maintaining access. Technical feedback is provided on appropriate means for countering each step of this
                    common methodology</p>
                    <p> Cloud Security
                        In this course, students will learn how to set up, use and maintain servers hosted on cloud platforms. Students will compare various cloud
                        infrastructures and analyze costs and benefits of cloud hosting. From there, students will practice deploying and administering cloud-based
                        applications, as well as being able to identify potential security issues and creating solutions to ensure secure applications.</p>
                        <p> Network Security Monitoring
                            Explore the world of Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and packet analysis. Network security monitoring takes a step past standard intrusion
                            detection models and collects the full spectrum of data types (event, session, full content and statistical) needed to identify and validate
                            intrusions on contemporary network infrastructures. This course will examine typical network security monitoring hardware, tools, design and
                            deployment. Standard vulnerability packet analysis scenarios will provide an in-depth appreciation of monitoring corporate-level networking
                            environments.</p>
                            <p> Shell Scripting for Technologists
                                The goal of this course is to provide network security students with a solid foundation in creating shell scripts and basic programming
                                concepts within UNIX/ Linux, specifically to aid in security related tasks. This course explores the creation of scripts to manage large amounts
                                of security-related data and automate normal active security operations. Students will write shell scripts to manage, correlate and analyze
                                security logs; pass variables from one security application to another to continue a flow of security activities; and to automate and simplify
                                security related tasks and processes. </p>
                                <p> Incident Response
                                    Although network teams possess the tools needed to secure their infrastructures, they often lack the skills for managing the incident response
                                    process. This course provides students with the skills needed to create processes for appropriately responding to security incidents. Students
                                    will learn to evaluate at what point are computers shut down and the organization disconnected from the Internet. Students will learn to
                                    analyze when is it best to let the intruders continue, so we can further determine their motivations, or goals. These processes are critical to
                                    ensuring that an incident doesn’t create greater organizational damage.</p>
                                    <p> Network Defense and Countermeasures
                                        The Network Defense and Countermeasures course is the art of fencing for network protection. This course covers designing a network
                                        defense, security policies, choosing and designing firewalls, configuring firewalls (demos and research), setting up VPNs, Intrusion Detection
                                        System overview and design, honey pots, and behavior-blocking software. Additionally, this course will provide solutions for identifying,
                                        assessing and preventing external and internal threats to your network in a multi-vendor environment.</p>
                                        <p> International and Federal INFOSEC Standards and Regulations
                                            This course is an overview of the world of federal and international information security standards that guide the way organizations are doing
                                            business today. Research and analysis are conducted on how US security regulations vary from industry to industry, including healthcare,
                                            education, military, federal organizations, utilities and financial organizations. International security standards will also be reviewed to
                                            understand the impact of implementing appropriate information security mechanisms in a global organization. </p>
                                            <p> Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition
                                                This course prepares students for a competition that specifically focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing
                                                commercial network infrastructure. Not only do students get a chance to test their knowledge in an operational environment, they will also get
                                                a chance to network with industry professionals. Due to the changing nature of the challenges, this course can be taken twice and credits
                                                received both times toward the appropriate degree.</p>
                                                <p> Security Evaluation and Assessment Methodology
                                                    The course is based on the National Security Agency’s (NSA) Information Security (INFOSEC) Evaluation Methodology (IEM), which is NSA’s
                                                    recommended methodology for evaluating an organization’s technical security. The course will examine the process of coordinating with the
                                                    customer, setting the scope of the project, obtaining legal authorization, conducting the ten baseline activities of the evaluation, and compiling
                                                    a meaningful and understandable final product for the customer. Students registering for this course will be required to participate in an actual
                                                    IEM based evaluation as a course project. </p>
